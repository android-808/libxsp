AC_PREREQ([2.57])

dnl
dnl Version should match the current Xsp version. XspQueryVersion
dnl returns the version from xsp.h, NOT the version we set here. But we
dnl try to keep these the same.  Note that the library has an extra
dnl digit in the version number to track changes which don't affect the
dnl protocol, so Xsp version l.n.m corresponds to protocol version l.n
